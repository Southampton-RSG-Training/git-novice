questions:
- "How do I track the changes I make to files using Git?"
objectives:
- "Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files."
- "Describe where changes are stored at each stage in the modify-add-commit cycle."
keypoints:
- "`git status` shows the status of a repository."
- "Files can be stored in a projectâ€™s working directory (which users see), the staging area (where the next commit is being built up) and the local repository (where commits are permanently recorded)."
- "`git add` puts files in the staging area."
- "`git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository."
- "Write commit messages that accurately describe your changes."
- "`git log --decorate` lists the commits made to the local repository, along with whether or not they are up-to-date with any remote repository."

## Tracking Changes

We've got a repository now containing a few pre-existing files - so let's add one more. You might remember seeing GitHub suggest we added a README.md to let people know what our code is about, so let's do that on the command line. We'll use the text editor `nano`, as:

~~~
$ nano README.md
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Then type an example description: 
~~~
# Climate Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of python scripts designed to analyse climate datafiles.
~~~
{: .output}

We can save our file using `Control-O` (`Control` and `O` at the same time), then `Enter`, and quit out of nano using `Control-X`. 
Our description is a bit brief, but it's enough for now!
Let's try `git status` again:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# On branch main
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	README.md
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

Now, whilst our current snapshot of the repository is up-to-date, we've added a new file that we're not tracking yet. We can tell Git to track the file we've just created using `git add`:

~~~
$ git add README.md
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and then check that the right thing happened:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   README.md
#
~~~
{: .output}

Git now knows that it's supposed to **keep track** of `README.md`, just like `climate_analysis.py` and `temp_conversion.py` but it **hasn't recorded that as a commit** yet. We dont have a snapshot of the repository with all the existing files *and* `README.md`.

### Initial Commit
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Added a basic readme file."
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We use the `-m` flag (for "**message**")
to record a short, **descriptive comment** that will help us remember later on what we did and why.

If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured at the start)
so that we can write a longer message.

**Good commit messages** start with a brief (<50 characters) summary of
changes made in the commit, **NOT "Bug Fixes"** or **"Changes"**!

If you want to go into more detail, add
a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.

~~~
[main fa90884] Added a basic readme file.
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a **[revision](reference.html#revision)**
and its short **identifier** is `fa90884`.
(Your revision will have different identifier.)

If we run `git status` now:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
# On branch main
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
{: .output}

it tells us our local repository is up-to-date, although now we have edits to it that the remote version of it doesn't (we'll get to that later!).

![Add and Commit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/04-changes/add.svg){:width="60%"}

Git has a special **staging** area
where it keeps track of things that have been **added** to
the current [change set](reference.html#change-set)
but **not yet committed**.
`git add` puts things in this area,
and `git commit` then copies them to long-term storage (as a commit)

> ## What's the Point of the Staging Area?
>
> Why do we have this two-stage process, where we **add** files to the staging area, then create a **commit** from them?
>
> Among other reasons, it allows you to easily bundle together a lot of changes in one go. If you changed the name of a variable used in multiple files (e.g. from `t` to `temperature`), you'd need to change it in all your files in one go in order for it to make sense.
> If you stored a copy of each file one-by-one you'd end up with a lot of versions of the code that didn't work - variables with different names everywhere. The **staging area** lets you bundle together all those small changes that don't work in isolation into one big change that's coherent. 
>
> Git does give you shortcuts to reduce **add -> commit** to a single step, but when you're starting out it's always better to make sure you know what's going in to each commit!

### Review the Log

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the **project's history** using `git log`:

~~~
$ git log
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
commit fa90884ca03dcefb97e415a374ac1aacaaa94c91 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Sam Mangham <mangham@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 16 15:22:29 2022 +0000

    Added a basic readme file.

commit 499b6d18b36a25d3f5ab9be1b708ea48fef1dd65 (origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Sam Mangham <mangham@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 16 14:19:13 2022 +0000

    Initial commit
~~~
{: .output}

`git log` lists all **revisions committed** to a repository in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top).

The listing for each revision includes

* the **revision's full identifier** (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
* the **branch** it was created on (including whether or not it's up-to-date with any **remote versions of that branch** - in this case, our last README commit hasn't been pushed to the remote repo yet),
* the revision's **author**,
* **when** it was created,
* the **log message** Git was given when the revision was committed.


{: .callout}
> ## Compatibility Notice
>
> If you don't see information on the **remote branches**, try `git log --decorate`. This ensures output will indicate, for each commit revision, whether it is up-to-date with its *remote* repository, if one exists. Older versions of git don't show this information by default.


### Modify a file (1)
Now suppose we modify an existing file, for example by adding a **Docstring** to the **top** of one of the files:

~~~
$ nano climate_analysis.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
""" Climate Analysis Tools """
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# On branch main
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   climate_analysis.py
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to **commit**".


So, while we have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
much less actually saved them (which we do with `git commit`).

**It's important to remember that git only stores changes when you make a commit**

### Review Changes and Commit
It is good practice to always **review
our changes** before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently commited version:

~~~
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/climate_analysis.py b/climate_analysis.py
index 277d6c7..d5b442d 100644
--- a/climate_analysis.py
+++ b/climate_analysis.py
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
+""" Climate Analysis Tools """
 import sys
 import temp_conversion
 import signal
~~~
{: .output}

The output is **cryptic** because
it is actually a series of **commands** for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how **to reconstruct one file given the other**.

The key things to note are:

 1. Line 1: The **files** that are being **compared** (a/ and b/ are labels, not paths)
 2. Line 2: The two **hex strings** on the second line which parts of the **hashes** of the files being compares
 3. Line 5: The **lines** that have changed. (It's complex)
 4. Below that, the changes - note the '**+**' marker which shows an addtion

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Add Docstring"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# On branch main
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   climate_analysis.py
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

**Whoops**:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

~~~
$ git add climate_analysis.py
$ git commit -m "Add Docstring"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[main 55d3f56] Add Docstring
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

Git insists that we **add** files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything
because we may not want to commit **everything at once**.

For example,
suppose we might have **fixed a bug** in some existing code, but we might have added new code that's **not ready to share**.


### One more addition

What if we've made some edits, added them, and then forgotten what they were?
Let's add another line to the end of the file:

~~~
$ nano climate_analysis.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# TODO(smangham): Add call to process rainfall
~~~
{: .output}

Check what's changed with **diff**:

~~~
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/climate_analysis.py b/climate_analysis.py
index d5b442d..6f8ed8a 100644
--- a/climate_analysis.py
+++ b/climate_analysis.py
@@ -26,3 +26,5 @@ for line in climate_data:

+
+# TODO(smangham): Add call to process rainfall
~~~
{: .output}

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).

Now let's put that change in the staging area (or **add it to the change set**), then go away for the weekend. When we come back, we can't remember what we added, so we see what `git diff` reports:

~~~
$ git add climate_analysis.py
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
~~~
{: .output}

**There is no output**! This is because **git diff** shows us the differences between the **working copy** and what's been added to the **change set** in staging area.

However, if we add the `--staged` flag to the command:

~~~
$ git diff --staged
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/climate_analysis.py b/climate_analysis.py

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`).
