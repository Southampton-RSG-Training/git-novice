## Project Demo Repository

We'll be showing you how to manage an example academic software project. 
If you've completed our **Version Control with git** workshop, you'll have a finished version of our `climate-analysis` repository ([you'll have used the template from here](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/git-novice-template/))
If not, please [create a copy of it from this template (linked here)](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/project-novice-template/generate), and name it `climate-analysis`.
