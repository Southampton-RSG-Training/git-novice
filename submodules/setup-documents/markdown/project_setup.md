## Project Demo Repository

We'll be showing you how to manage an example academic software project. 
If you've completed our [Version Control with git workshop (linked here)](https://southampton-rsg-training.github.io/git-novice/) , you'll have an example project.
If not, please [create a copy of our demo repository from this template (linked here)](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/project-novice-climate-analysis/generate),
and name it `climate-analysis`. You don't need to run this code as part of the course! It's purely for demonstration purposes.
