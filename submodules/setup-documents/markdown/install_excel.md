## Install Microsoft Excel

Microsoft Excel is commonly provided by most institutions with the Microsoft Office suite via an instututional licence. 
On Windows and MacOS, Microsoft Excel can be downloaded using the Microsoft Store and the App Store respectively. 
On Linux, you may use Microsoft Excel in a web browser. This is not reccomended and we suggest you use an alterntive such as LibreOffice
instead. If you do not have access to a Microsoft Office licence, please use an alternative such as LibreOffice.
