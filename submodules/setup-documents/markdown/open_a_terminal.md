## Open a Terminal ##

For this lesson, first you need to be able to open a terminal:

- **On Windows:** We'll be using Git Bash. If you've already installed Git Bash then go to the next section. Otherwise, go to [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click **Download**, then install it. 
Most of the options can be left on default, but be sure you check these:
  - **Choosing the default editor used by Git:** Make sure **Nano** is selected from the drop-down. If you're comfortable with other editors, feel free to change it, but we recommend Nano - we use it as it's present on Windows, Mac *and* Linux. If you change it, you might not quite match what we're doing on-screen.
  - **Adjusting your PATH environment:** Make sure **Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software** is selected.
  - **Choosing HTTPS transport backend:** Make sure **Use the native Windows Secure Channel Library** is selected.
  - **Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash:** Make sure **Use Windows' default console window** is selected.

- **On Mac OS X:** accessed by opening the “Terminal” application, which can be found in the “Utilities” folder which is in your “Applications” folder.
- **On Linux:** this will depend on the Linux distribution you are running, but you should be able to find a "Terminal" application in your desktop's application menu.
