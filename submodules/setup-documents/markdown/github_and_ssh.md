## GitHub ##
Later on in the session, we'll be demonstrating how to share work with collaborators using [GitHub](https://github.com/). You'll need to [create an account there](https://github.com/signup). As your GitHub username will appear in the URLs of your projects there, it's best to use a short, clear version of your name if you can.

In addition, we'll need to set up SSH access to GitHub from your computer. This is how GitHub checks your identity when you try to access it - and is more secure than a password. To set up SSH access, we generate a pair of keys - one public, one private. We want to add the public key to GitHub, whilst the private one stays on our computer.

There are full guides in the GitHub documentation for how to [Make an SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [Add an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). However today we have simplified it like so:

First we need to create a variable to store your GitHub email. Copy this command, substituting the email you signed up to GitHub with for `your_github_email@example.com`:
~~~
$ my_gh_email=your_github_email@example.com
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Then we can run the following command to generate a key-pair and display the public half:
~~~
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C $my_gh_email; eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"; ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519; cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You will need to press enter a few times to select default options, and set the passphrase to empty.

Copy the last line of output that starts with `ssh-ed25519` and ends with your email (it may have gone over multiple lines if your terminal isn't wide enough).

Finally, go to [your Settings -> SSH keys page and add a new SSH key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new) (you'll need to be logged into GitHub with the account you have created). Give the key a memorable name (e.g. the name of the computer you are working on) and paste the key from your clipboard into the box labelled key. Then, click **Add SSH key** and you're done!
