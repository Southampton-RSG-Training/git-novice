## Python Setup ##

IDEs: PyCharm, Spyder, VS Code

We use Python 3*. The “Anaconda3” package provides everything Python-related you will need for the workshop. 
To install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), follow the instructions below.

Some old research projects may be in Python 2 but Python 2 has been retired and new projects should be in Python 3.

### Windows
Download the latest Anaconda Windows installer. Double-click the installer and follow the instructions. **When asked “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable”, answer “yes”. It will warn you not to, but it's required for it to be found by git bash** After it’s finished, close and reopen any open terminals to reload the updated PATH and allow the installed Python to be found.

Once the Anaconda installation is finished you will be asked if you want the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by
running conda init? You should select yes. Alternatively/additionally you will need to run the following command in 
GitBash

{: .bash}
~~~
conda init bash
~~~

Then close and reopen GitBash.

Please test the python install open GitBash (or your favorite terminal) and run the following command to verify that the installation was successful.

{: .bash}
~~~
cd ~
python
~~~

You can then type the following to exit:
{: .python}
~~~
quit()
~~~

{: .callout}
~~~
In some cases GitBash will hang on this command and not launch the Python interpreter. 
In this case close and reopen git bash and issue the following commands:
~~~

{: .bash}
~~~
cd ~
echo 'alias python="winpty python.exe"' >> .bashrc
source .bashrc
python
~~~


### Mac OS X

#### Mac OS Intel
Download the latest Anaconda Mac OS X installer. Double-click the .pkg file and follow the instructions.

#### Mac OS M1
If you have a M1 Mac you need a specific version of Anaconda follow the link below. 

[M1 Compatible Anaconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-MacOSX-arm64.pkg)

Once the Anaconda installation is finished you will be asked if you want the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by
running conda init? You should select yes.

### Linux
Download the latest Anaconda Linux Installer.

Install via the terminal like this (you will need to change the version number to the latest version):

First move to the folder where you downloaded the installer, this is likely to be the Downloads folder e.g.

~~~
$ cd ~/Downloads
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
$ bash Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Answer ‘yes’ to allow the installer to initialize Anaconda3 in your .bashrc.
