## Introduction to the Data for this Lesson ##
The data used in this lesson comes from a project observing a small mammal community in southern
Arizona, US. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant
community that has been running for almost 40 years. The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots,
with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.
This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. It is published at [Ecological Archives](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and can be found on [Portal Project Database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData). This data is open and free to use for research purposes.
