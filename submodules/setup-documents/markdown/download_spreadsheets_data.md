## Data for Spreadsheets Lesson

The data used in this lesson comes from a project observing a small mammal community in southern
Arizona, US. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant
community that has been running for almost 40 years. The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots,
with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.
This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. It is published at [Ecological Archives](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and can be found on [Portal Project Database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData). This data is open and free to use for research purposes.

For the purposes of training, this data has been simplified a bit (you can still download the full dataset and work with it using exactly the same tools we will learn here). This simplified version of data is available from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459). In this lesson, you will need to download the following five files from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459):
-  [messy_survey_data.xls](data/messy_survey_data.xlsx) - this is the main file we will work with. It includes messy survey data
(in Excel's `.xlsx` format) that you will clean during the lesson and use to learn some best practices in
data organisation.
