## Download Data for Spreadsheets Lesson ##

For the purposes of training, this data has been simplified a bit (you can still download the full dataset and work with it using exactly the same tools we will learn here). This simplified version of data is available from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459). In this lesson, you will need to download the following five files from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459):
-  [messy_survey_data.xls](data/messy_survey_data.xlsx) - this is the main file we will work with. It includes messy survey data
(in Excel's `.xlsx` format) that you will clean during the lesson and use to learn some best practices in
data organisation.
- [surveys.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172) - the cleaned survey data
    Fields: `record_id`, `month`, `day`, `year`, `plot_id`, `species_id`, `sex`, `hindfoot_length`, `weight`
- [plots.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474) - clean information on plot number and type
    Fields: `plot_id`, `plot_type`
- [species.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483) - clean information on species codes and scientific names
    Fields: `species_id`, `genus`, `species`, `taxa`
- [combined.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/10717186) - clean data from surveys, plots and species data
files combined into one clean file (a good example of what a clean data file should look like)
Fields: `record_id`, `month`, `day`, `year`, `plot_id`, `species_id`, `sex`, `hindfoot_length`, `weight`, `genus`,
`species`, `taxa`, `plot_type`
